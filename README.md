# Scorecard

An app to keep track of scores in a game


To start the client (requires node.js):

```
    cd scorecard-svelte
    npm install
    npm run dev
```

To start the server (requires java):

```
    cd scorecard-api
    mvn spring-boot:run
```

Note that the client, server, and database are NOT connected (to simplify deployment and testing)
